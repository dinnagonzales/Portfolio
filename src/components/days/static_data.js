        I wanted this space to be spotless. The 'best design and layout' with 'x number of projects'. A true to life rendition of 'perfect never gets done'. With all the time
         I now have in my hands, being in quarantine and all, I finally bucked up and decided that this space will not be spotless. Instead, it will be just that- something that
         takes up space. This will be my tiny corner in the vast universe that is the internet and it will showcase whatever I am working on outside of my day job. I don't want this first
         post to be too long, so I'm going to end it with an anecdote about my journey to becoming the developer that I am today.
        
          I was 15 the first time I was introduced to HTML & CSS. I remember being so excited when I recreated the website of a 
          cartoon I liked(Emily the Strange). I replaced her name with mine and added photos of me and my friends! I seem to have forgotten how much I enjoy coding and how fun it is to just create. So in honor of my younger self, I worked
           on creating a cartoon with just pure HTML and css. It's so cute! I'm in love.
